# popDisease
This code runs stochastic population dynamics models combined with epidemiological SIRS models to assess the impact of 
a given disease in the population dynamics of a give species. It uses age-specific demographic rates, as well as
age-specific epidemiological rates. The models are based on the manuscript Colchero et al (in prep).
